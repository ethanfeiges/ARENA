The discriminator sees the images, but not the labels (i.e. whether the images are real or fake), and it is trained to distinguish between real and fake images with maximum accuracy. The discriminator's loss function is the cross entropy between its probability estimates ($D(x)$ for real images, $D(G(z))$ for fake images) and the true labels ($1$ for real images, $0$ for fake images).\n","\n","### Generator\n","\n","The architecture of generators in a GAN setup is generally a mirror image of the discriminator, with convolutions swapped out for **transposed convolutions**. This is the case for the DCGAN paper we'll be reading (which is why they only give a diagram of the generator, not both). The generator works by taking in a vector $z$, whose elements are all normally distributed with mean 0 and variance 1. We call the space from which $z$ is sampled **latent dimension** or **latent space**, and we call $z$ a **latent vector**. The formal definition of a latent space is *an abstract multi-dimensional space that encodes a meaningful internal representation of externally observed events.* We'll dive a little deeper into what this means and the overall significance of latent spaces later on, but for now it's fine to understand this vector $z$ as a kind of random seed, which causes the generator to produce different outputs. After all, if the generator only ever produced the same image as output then the discriminator's job would be pretty easy (just subtract the image $g$ always produces from the input image, and see if the result is close to zero!). The generator's objective function is an increasing function of $D(G(z))$, in other words it tries to produce images $G(z)$ which have a high chance of fooling the discriminator (i.e. $D(G(z)) \\approx 1$).\n","\n","### Convergence\n","\n","The ideal outcome when training a GAN is for the generator to produce perfect output indistinguishable from real images, and the discriminator just guesses randomly. However, the precise nature of the situations when GANs converge is an ongoing area of study (in general, adversarial networks have very unstable training patterns). For example, you can imagine a situation where the discriminator becomes almost perfect at spotting fake outputs, because of some feature that the discriminator spots and that the generator fails to capture in its outputs. It will be very difficult for the generator to get a training signal, because it has to figure out what feature is missing from its outputs, and how it can add that feature to fool the discriminator. And to make matters worse, maybe marginal steps in that direction will only increase the probability of fooling the discriminator from almost-zero to slightly-more-than-almost-zero, which isn't much of a training signal! Later on we will see techniques people have developed to overcome problems like this and others, but in general they can't be solved completely.\n","\n","<details>\n","<summary>Optional exercise - what conditions must hold for the discriminator's best strategy to be random guessing with probability 0.5?</summary>\n","\n","It is necessary for the generator to be producing perfect outputs, because otherwise the discriminator could do better than random guessing.\n","\n","If the generator is producing perfect outputs, then the discriminator never has any ability to distinguish real from fake images, so it has no information. Its job is to minimise the cross entropy between its output distribution $(D(x), 1-D(x))$, and the distribution of real/fake images. Call this $(p, 1-p)$, i.e. $p$ stands for the proportion of images in training which are real. Note how we just used $p$ rather than $p(x)$, because there's no information in the image $x$ which indicates whether it is real or fake. Trying to minimize the cross entropy between $(p, 1-p)$ and $(D(x), 1-D(x))$ gives us the solution $D(x) = p$ for all $x$. In other words, our discriminator guesses real/fake randomly with probability equal to the true underlying frequency of real/fake images in the data. This is 0.5 if and only if the data contains an equal number of real and fake images.\n","\n","To summarize, the necessary and sufficient conditions for $(\\forall x) \\; D(x) = 0.5$ being the optimal strategy are:\n","\n","* The generator $G$ produces perfect output\n","* The underlying frequency of real/fake images in the data is 50/50\n","\n","</details>\n","\n","<br>\n","\n","<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/callummcdougall/computational-thread-art/master/example_images/misc/gan_images/dcgan-9-solid.png\" width=\"1000\">\n"],"metadata":{"id":"_vXVRxy77ncr"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Transposed Convolutions\n","\n","**What are transposed convolutions, and why should we care about them?** One high-level intuition goes something like this: most of the generator's architecture is basically the discriminator architecture in reverse. We need something that performs the reverse of a convolution - not literally the inverse operation, but something reverse in spirit, which uses a kernel of weights to project up to some array of larger size.\n","\n","**Importantly, a transposed convolution isn't literally the inverse of a convolution**. A lot of confusion can come from misunderstanding this!\n","\n","You can describe the difference between convolutions and transposed convolutions as follows:\n","\n","* In convolutions, you slide the kernel around inside the input.

So the gradients here are very steep, and a small improvement in $G$ goes a long way.\n","\n","It's worth emphasising that these two functions are both monotonic in opposite directions, so maximising one is equivalent to minimising the other.

Essentially, the discriminator gets so good at its job that the generator can't latch onto a good gradient for improving its performance. Although the theoretical formulation of GANs as a minimax game is elegant, there are quite a few assumptions that have to go into it in order for there to be one theoretical optimum involving the generator producing perfect images - and in practice this is rarely achieved, even in the limit.\n","\n","Different architectures like diffusion models and VAEs (which we'll move onto next) perform much better."],"metadata":{"id":"3_8Htz90N3W5"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Bonus - Smooth interpolation\n","\n","Suppose you take two vectors in the latent space.

The way we learn a distribution is very similar to the way we learn our fixed inputs for the autoencoder, i.e. we have a bunch of linear or convolutional layers, our input is the original image, and our output is the tuple of parameters $(\\mu(\\boldsymbol{x}), \\Sigma(\\boldsymbol{x}))$ (as a trivial example, our VAE learning a distribution $\\mu(\\boldsymbol{x})=z(\\boldsymbol{x})$, $\\Sigma(\\boldsymbol{x})=0$ is equivalent to our autoencoder learning the function $z(\\boldsymbol{x})$ as its encoder).\n","\n","From this [TowardsDataScience](https://towardsdatascience.com/understanding-variational-autoencoders-vaes-f70510919f73) article:\n","\n","> Due to overfitting, the latent space of an autoencoder can be extremely irregular (close points in latent space can give very *different* decoded data, some point of the latent space can give *meaningless* content once decoded) and, so, we can’t really define a *generative* process that simply consists to sample a point from the *latent space* and make it go through the decoder to get new data. *Variational autoencoders* (VAEs) are autoencoders that tackle the problem of the latent space irregularity by making the encoder return a *distribution over the latent space* instead of a single point and by adding in the loss function a *regularisation* term over that returned distribution in order to ensure a better *organisation* of the latent space.\n","\n","Or, in fewer words:\n","\n","> **A variational autoencoder can be defined as being an autoencoder whose training is regularised to avoid overfitting and ensure that the latent space has good properties that enable generative process.**\n","\n","At first, this idea of mapping to a distribution sounds like a crazy hack - why on earth does it work?

It's hypothetically possible that our network was mapping all the inputs to some very small subspace and reconstructing them with perfect fidelity. This wouldn't have required numbers with different features to be far apart from each other in the latent space, because even if they are close together no information is lost. See the first image above.\n","\n","But with our variational autoencoder, each MNIST image produces a **sample** from the latent space, with a certain mean and variance. This means that, when two numbers look very different, their latent vectors are forced apart - if the means were close together then the decoder wouldn't be able to reconstruct them.\n","\n","Another nice property of using random latent vectors is that the entire latent space will be meaningful. For instance, with autoencoders there is no reason why we should expect the linear interpolation between two points in the latent space to have meaningful decodings. The decoder output *will* change continuously as we continuously vary the latent vector, but that's about all we can say about it. However, if we use a variational autoencoder, we don't have this problem.

This is why it's important to add a KL-divergence term to the loss function, to make sure this doesn't happen. It's also why, if you print out the average value of $\\sigma(\\boldsymbol{x})$ while training, you'll probably see it stay below 1 (it's being pulled towards 1 by the KL-divergence loss, **and** pulled towards 0 by the reconstruction loss).\n","\n","---\n","\n","Before you move on to implementation details, there are a few questions below designed to test your understanding.

You can try training your VAE without this term, and it might do okay at reproducing $\\boldsymbol{x}$, but it will perform much worse when it comes time to use it for generation.

If you'd like to take a deeper dive into the mathematical justifications of this loss function, you can read the following content. I'd consider it pretty essential in laying the groundwork for understanding diffusion models, and most kinds of generative image models (which we might dip into later in this course).\n","\n","Firstly, let's flip the model we currently have on its head. Rather than having some method of sampling images $\\boldsymbol{x}$ from our image set, then having a function mapping images to latent vectors $\\boldsymbol{z}$, we will start with the decoder $p_\\theta$ which:\n","* first generates the latent vector $\\boldsymbol{z}$ from distribution $p(\\boldsymbol{z})$ (which we assume to be the standard normal distribution $N(0, I)$),\n","* then generates $\\boldsymbol{x}$ from the conditional distribution $p_\\theta(\\boldsymbol{x} \\mid \\boldsymbol{z})$.\n","\n","It may help to imagine $\\boldsymbol{z}$ as being some kind of efficient encoding of all the information in our image distribution (e.g. if our images were celebrity faces, we could imagine the components of the vector $\\boldsymbol{z}$ might correspond to features like gender, hair color, etc) - and $p_\\theta(\\boldsymbol{x} \\mid \\boldsymbol{z})$ is some kind of probabilitistic way of reconstructing faces from this information. Note the distinction here - we're assuming our decoder is a probability distribution, rather than a deterministic function like we've used above (we'll return to this point below).\n","\n","We can recover the probability distribution of $\\boldsymbol{x}$ by integrating over all possible values of the latent vector $\\boldsymbol{z}$:\n","$$\n","\\begin{aligned}\n","p(\\boldsymbol{x})&=\\int_z p_\\theta(\\boldsymbol{x} \\mid \\boldsymbol{z}) p(\\boldsymbol{z}) \\; d \\boldsymbol{z} \\\\\n","&= \\mathbb{E}_{\\boldsymbol{z} \\sim p(\\boldsymbol{z})}\\big[p_\\theta(\\boldsymbol{x} \\mid \\boldsymbol{z})\\big]\n","\\end{aligned}\n","$$\n","We can interpret this as the probability that our decoder $p_\\theta(\\cdot \\mid \\boldsymbol{z})$ produces the image $\\boldsymbol{x}$ when we feed it some noise sampled from the standard normal distribution. So all we have to do is maximize the expected value of this expression over our sample of real images $x_i$, then we're training our decoder to produce images like the ones in our set of real images, right?\n","\n","Unfortunately, it's not that easy. Evaluating this integral would be computationally intractible, because we would have to sample over all possible values for the latent vectors $\\boldsymbol{z}$:\n","$$\n","\\theta^*=\\underset{\\theta}{\\operatorname{argmax}}\\; \\mathbb{E}_{x \\sim \\hat{p}(\\boldsymbol{x}),\\, \\boldsymbol{z} \\sim p(\\boldsymbol{z})}\\big[\\log p_\\theta(\\boldsymbol{x} \\mid \\boldsymbol{z})\\big]\n","$$\n","where $\\hat{p}(\\boldsymbol{x})$ denotes our distribution over samples of $\\boldsymbol{x}$. This will take an exponentially long time to evaluate, because *we're having to sample $\\boldsymbol{x}$ and $\\boldsymbol{z}$ separately* - we'll only feasibly be able to capture a very small fraction of the latent space of $\\boldsymbol{z}$.\n","\n","*(Note, we've written $\\log{p_\\theta}$ here because it's usually easier to think about maximizing the log probability than the actual probability.)*\n","\n","Imagine now that we had a function $q_\\phi(\\boldsymbol{z} \\mid \\boldsymbol{x})$, which is high when **the latent vector $\\boldsymbol{z}$ is likely to have been produced by $\\boldsymbol{x}$**. This function would be really helpful, because for each possible value of $\\boldsymbol{x}$ we would have a better idea of where to sample $\\boldsymbol{z}$ from. We can represent this situation with the following **graphical model**:\n","\n","<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/callummcdougall/computational-thread-art/master/example_images/misc/gan_images/vae-graphical.png\" width=\"500\">\n","\n","The seemingly intractible optimization problem above is replaced with a much easier one:\n","$$\n","\\begin{aligned}\n","p(\\boldsymbol{x}) &=\\int q_\\phi(\\boldsymbol{z} \\mid \\boldsymbol{x}) \\frac{p_\\theta(\\boldsymbol{x} \\mid \\boldsymbol{z}) p(\\boldsymbol{z})}{q_\\phi(\\boldsymbol{z} \\mid \\boldsymbol{x})} \\;d \\boldsymbol{z}\\\\\n","\\theta^*&=\\underset{\\theta}{\\operatorname{argmax}}\\; \\mathbb{E}_{\\boldsymbol{x} \\sim \\hat{p}(\\boldsymbol{x}), \\boldsymbol{z} \\sim q_\\phi(\\boldsymbol{z}\\mid \\boldsymbol{x})}\\left[\\frac{p_\\theta(\\boldsymbol{x} \\mid \\boldsymbol{z})p(\\boldsymbol{z})}{q_\\phi(\\boldsymbol{z} \\mid \\boldsymbol{x})}\\right]\n","\\end{aligned}\n","$$\n","Note that this is exactly the same expression as before; we've just rearranged it by introducing the $q_\\phi$ term, so that the distribution of $\\boldsymbol{z}$ we're taking expectation over is now conditioned on $\\boldsymbol{x}$.\n","\n","Why is this problem easier? Because in order to estimate the quantity above, we don't need to sample a huge number of latent vectors $\\boldsymbol{z}$ for each possible value of $\\boldsymbol{x}$. The probability distribution $q_\\phi(\\boldsymbol{z} \\mid \\boldsymbol{x})$ already concentrates most of our probability mass for where $\\boldsymbol{z}$ should be, so we can sample according to this instead.\n","\n","We now introduce an important quantity, called the **ELBO**, or **evidence lower-bound**. It is defined as follows (note that it is a function of $\\boldsymbol{x}$, i.e. $\\boldsymbol{x}$ is not a free variable):\n","$$\n","\\mathbb{E}_{\\boldsymbol{z} \\sim q_\\phi(\\boldsymbol{z} \\mid \\boldsymbol{x})}\\left[\\log \\frac{p_\\theta(\\boldsymbol{x} \\mid \\boldsymbol{z})p(\\boldsymbol{z})}{q_\\phi(\\boldsymbol{z} \\mid \\boldsymbol{x})}\\right]\n","$$\n","\n","This is called the ELBO because it's a lower bound for the quantity $p(\\boldsymbol{x})$, which we call the **evidence**. The proof for this being a lower bound comes from **Jensen's inequality**, which states that $\\mathbb{E}[f(X)] \\geq f(\\mathbb{E}[X])$ for any convex function $f$ (and $f(\\boldsymbol{x})=-\\log(\\boldsymbol{x})$ is convex). In fact, [we can prove](https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2018-08-12-vae/#loss-function-elbo) the following identity holds:\n","$$\n","\\log{p(\\boldsymbol{x})}=\\mathbb{E}_{\\mathbb{z} \\sim q_{\\boldsymbol{\\phi}}(\\boldsymbol{z} \\mid \\boldsymbol{x})}\\left[\\log \\frac{p(\\boldsymbol{z}) p_\\theta(\\boldsymbol{x} \\mid \\boldsymbol{z})}{q_{\\boldsymbol{\\phi}}(\\boldsymbol{z} \\mid \\boldsymbol{x})}\\right]+D_{\\mathrm{KL}}\\left(q_{\\boldsymbol{\\phi}}(\\boldsymbol{z} \\mid \\boldsymbol{x}) \\,\\|\\, p_\\theta(\\boldsymbol{z} \\mid \\boldsymbol{x})\\right)\n","$$\n","So the evidence minus the ELBO is equal to the KL divergence between the distribution $q_\\phi$ and the **posterior distribution** $p_\\theta(\\boldsymbol{z} \\mid \\boldsymbol{x})$ (the order of $\\boldsymbol{z}$ and $\\boldsymbol{x}$ have been swapped). KL divergence is always non-negative, hence the lower bound.\n","\n","---\n","\n","Finally, this brings us to VAEs. With VAEs, we treat $p_\\theta(\\boldsymbol{x} \\mid \\boldsymbol{z})$ as our decoder, $q_\\phi(\\boldsymbol{z} \\mid \\boldsymbol{x})$ as our encoder, and we train them jointly to minimise the ELBO (or rather the expected value of the ELBO over our dataset $\\boldsymbol{x} \\sim \\hat{p}(\\boldsymbol{x}))$. Using the previous identity, we see that maximizing the ELBO is equivalent to maximizing the following:\n","$$\n","\\log{p(\\boldsymbol{x})}-D_{\\mathrm{KL}}\\left(q_{\\boldsymbol{\\phi}}(\\boldsymbol{z} \\mid \\boldsymbol{x}) \\,\\|\\, p_\\theta(\\boldsymbol{z} \\mid \\boldsymbol{x})\\right)\n","$$\n","In other words, we are maximizing the log-likelihood, and ***at the same time*** penalising any difference between our approximate posterior $q_\\phi(\\boldsymbol{z} \\mid \\boldsymbol{x})$ and our true posterior $p_\\theta(\\boldsymbol{z} \\mid \\boldsymbol{x})$.\n","\n","---\n","\n","We can rewrite the ELBO in a different way:\n","$$\n","\\begin{aligned}\n","\\mathbb{E}_{\\boldsymbol{z} \\sim q_\\phi(\\boldsymbol{z} \\mid \\boldsymbol{x})}\\left[\\log \\frac{p_{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}(\\boldsymbol{x} \\mid \\boldsymbol{z}) p(\\boldsymbol{z})}{q_{\\boldsymbol{\\phi}}(\\boldsymbol{z} \\mid \\boldsymbol{x})}\\right] & =\\mathbb{E}_{\\mathbb{z} \\sim q_{\\boldsymbol{\\phi}}(\\boldsymbol{z} \\mid \\boldsymbol{x})}\\left[\\log p_{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}(\\boldsymbol{x} \\mid \\boldsymbol{z})\\right]+\\mathbb{E}_{\\boldsymbol{z} \\sim q_\\phi(\\boldsymbol{z} \\mid \\boldsymbol{x})}\\left[\\log \\frac{p(\\boldsymbol{z})}{q_{\\boldsymbol{\\phi}}(\\boldsymbol{z} \\mid \\boldsymbol{x})}\\right] \\\\\n","& =\\underbrace{\\mathbb{E}_{\\boldsymbol{z} \\sim q_\\phi(\\boldsymbol{z} \\mid \\boldsymbol{x})}\\left[\\log p_{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}(\\boldsymbol{x} \\mid \\boldsymbol{z})\\right]}_{\\text {reconstruction loss}}-\\underbrace{D_{\\mathrm{KL}}\\left(q_{\\boldsymbol{\\phi}}(\\boldsymbol{z} \\mid \\boldsymbol{x}) \\| p(\\boldsymbol{z})\\right)}_{\\text {regularisation term}}\n","\\end{aligned}\n","$$\n","which is now starting to look a lot more like (the negative of) the loss function we used earlier!\n","                \n","To further justify this claim:\n","\n","* **The first term** is playing the role of reconstruction loss. This might not be obvious at first, but notice that minimising it is equivalent to *maximising the probability of the decoder reconstructing $\\boldsymbol{x}$ from $\\boldsymbol{z}$, given that $\\boldsymbol{z}$ was itself a latent vector produced by our encoder on input $\\boldsymbol{x}$*. If our model perfectly preserves $\\boldsymbol{x}$ in the series of maps $\\boldsymbol{x} \\xrightarrow{\\text{encoder}} \\boldsymbol{z} \\xrightarrow{\\text{decoder}} \\boldsymbol{x}$ then this reconstruction loss term would be zero (because the probability would be 1, and the logprob would be 0). In fact, we can just swap this term out for any reasonable reconstruction loss (for instance, the $l_2$ loss that we used in the last section) - and that's exactly what we did!\n","\n","* **The second term** is the KL divergence between$q_\\phi(\\boldsymbol{z} \\mid \\boldsymbol{x})$ (the distribution of latent vectors produced by your VAE when given inputs $\\boldsymbol{x}$) and $p_{\\theta}(\\boldsymbol{z})$ (the true generative distribution of latent vectors $\\boldsymbol{z}$). Note that both of these distributions are known to us - the first is normal with mean $\\mu(\\boldsymbol{x})$ and variance $\\sigma(\\boldsymbol{x})^2$, and the second is just the standard normal distribution with mean 0, variance 1 (see [Figure 6](https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2018-08-12-vae/#beta-vae:~:text=.-,Fig.%206.,-The%20graphical%20model) in the blog post). So this term is exactly equal to the KL divergence term in our loss function.\n","\n","The decoder used in our VAE isn't actually probabilistic $p_\\theta(\\cdot \\mid \\boldsymbol{z})$, it's deterministic (i.e. it's a map from latent vector $\\boldsymbol{z}$ to reconstructed input $\\boldsymbol{x}'$). But we can pretend that the decoder output is actually the mean of a probability distribution, and we're choosing this mean as the value of our reconstruction $\\boldsymbol{x}'$. The reconstruction loss term in the formula above will be smallest when this mean is close to the original value $\\boldsymbol{x}$ (because then $p_\\theta(\\cdot \\mid \\boldsymbol{z})$ will be a probability distribution centered around $\\boldsymbol{x}$). And it turns out that we can just replace this reconstruction loss with something that fulfils basically the same purpose (the $L_2$ penalty) - although we sometimes need to adjust these two terms (see $\\beta$-VAEs above).\n","\n","And that's the math of VAEs in a nutshell!"],"metadata":{"id":"4rts25NnE8wY"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Bonus exercises\n","\n","### PCA\n","\n","In the code earlier, we visualised our autoencoder / VAE output along the first two dimensions of the latent space.
